# European Bike Sales Dashboard 

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bike sales data across Europe, leveraging the power of Power BI to create dynamic and interactive dashboards. 
The dataset, spanning from 2011 to 2016, includes over 113,000 records with key information on customer demographics, product categories, and regional sales performance. 
Through this analysis, the project aims to uncover trends in revenue, profit margins, and customer behavior, offering insights into the store's overall performance and
highlighting opportunities for strategic business improvements.

The overview sales dashboard should answer the following questions:

1. What is the total revenue, number of orders completed, profit margin, and total profit generated by the store?
2. What are the yearly trends in profits and revenue generated?
3. What are the monthly trends in revenue and profit across all European countries?
4. How does revenue fluctuate daily?
5. Which European countries generated the most revenue and profits?
6. Is there a noticeable gender disparity in revenue generation across all regions?
7. What are the trends in revenue across different age groups within the dataset?
8. How did different product categories perform in terms of overall revenue generation?
9. Which top 5 sub-categories of products generated the highest revenue?

## Insights
1. **Overall Performance**: The store generated a significant revenue of $85 million, with a profit of $32 million from 1.3 million orders. This translates to an impressive profit margin of 38%.

2. **Yearly Growth:** Revenue and profits steadily increased from 2011 to 2016, with notable growth in the later years, indicating successful business expansion and market penetration.

3. **Monthly Trends:** There were notable monthly fluctuations in revenue and profit, with peaks and troughs throughout the year. A significant increase towards the end of the year suggests higher demand during that period, potentially driven by seasonal factors.

4. **Daily Sales Variability:** Daily revenue shows variability, with certain days experiencing higher sales. This could be attributed to specific patterns or promotional events that drive these peaks.

5. **Regional Performance:** The United States leads both in revenue ($28M) and profit ($11M), followed by Australia ($21M revenue, $7M profit), the United Kingdom ($21M revenue, $4M profit), Germany ($9M revenue, $3M profit), France ($8M revenue, $3M profit), and Canada ($8M revenue, $4M profit). This indicates higher demand and more lucrative markets in the United States and Australia compared to other regions.

6. **Demographic Insights:** Sales are relatively balanced between male and female customers, with a slight edge towards male customers.
The age group of 35–64 contributes the most to revenue, followed by young adults (25–34) and youth (under 25). Seniors (64+) contribute the least.

7. **Product Performance:** Bikes are the top-selling category with $62M in revenue, followed by Accessories ($15M) and Clothing ($8M).
The top 5 sub-categories are Road Bikes, Mountain Bikes, Touring Bikes, Helmets, and Tires and Tubes, with Road bikes and Mountain bikes leading by revenue.

## Recommendations 
1. Allocate more resources to the United States and Australia because they generate the highest revenue and profits. Consider launching targeted marketing campaigns, expanding product offerings, and improving supply chains in these regions.

2. Increase marketing campaigns and promotions during the end-of-year period to capitalize on the significant increase in demand. This strategy can boost sales and profits during peak periods.

3. Invest in expanding the range of top-selling sub-categories, such as Road Bikes and Mountain Bikes. Introducing new models, features, or complementary accessories within these categories can attract more customers.

4. Develop marketing strategies targeting the 35–64 age bracket because it is the highest revenue contributor. Tailor promotional content and offers to appeal to this demographic's preferences and needs.

5. While bikes are the top-selling category, ensure that accessories and clothing are adequately stocked and promoted. Offering bundles or discounts on these items with bike purchases can increase their sales.
